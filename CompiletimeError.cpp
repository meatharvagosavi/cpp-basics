/* Explanation 
While running the faulty program, at the compilation stage the program execution will stop. Under the problems tab or console tab, you will get two noticeable errors.
Error: expected ';' after class
Solution: A class definition requires a semi-colon at the end. 
Error: 'phNo' is a private member of 'Employee'
Solution: You cannot access a private member of a class inside a function which is defined outside the class. So you must declare that function as a friend function within the class under the public section.
